# Docker

- Docker is used to 
- - Build and run an image as a container
- - Share images using Docker Hub
- - Deploy Docker applications using multiple containers with a database
- - Run applications using Docker Compose

## What is a container?

Simply put, a container is a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on the host machine. That isolation leverages kernel namespaces and cgroups, features that have been in Linux for a long time. Docker has worked to make these capabilities approachable and easy to use. To summarize, a container:

   - is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the DockerAPI or CLI.
   - can be run on local machines, virtual machines or deployed to the cloud.
   - is portable (can be run on any OS).
   - is isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, and configurations.

## What is a container image?

When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem is provided by a container image. Since the image contains the containerâ€™s filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configuration for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.
